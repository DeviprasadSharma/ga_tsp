# Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem using Genetic Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of a GA that can be
used to find optimal solutions for the Traveling Salesman Problem. The
instances of the problems that the program supports are `.tsp` files, which is
a widespread format in this problem. 

To run the code, only Python 3 and the dependencies `matplotlib` and `numpy`
which are included in the Anaconda distribution by default) are needed. In case
you are not using Anaconda, you can install all the dependencies with:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

To run the code, simply execute:
`python3 main.py assets/<asset_name>.tsp`
